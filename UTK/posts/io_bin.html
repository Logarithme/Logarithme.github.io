			<h1> File format .bin </h1>
			
			<p>UnicornTK relies on the extension of the input file to determine its type.
			When the extension is .dat, the pointsets are stored in binary mode, without any header.
		        It is much more efficient than ascii based format like .dat or .edat, and 
		        is usually less memory expensive.</p>
		        
		        <p>Example in unit-tests/testIO_BIN.cpp</p>
