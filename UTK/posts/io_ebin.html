			<h1> File format .ebin </h1>
			
			<p>UnicornTK relies on the extension of the input file to determine its type.
			When the extension is .edat, the pointsets are stored in ASCII mode, with a header
			containing the extend of the pointset domain and the toricity of the pointset.
			It is much more efficient than ascii based format like .dat or .edat, and 
		        is usually less memory expensive.
